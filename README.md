Bugs:
  The project currently only allows for one item to be used at a time, such as only one arrow. Link can also chnage items mid animation, meaning the animations do not complete. When Link uses sword looking up or to the left, link moves back as the animation starts in the top left cornor of link. Link can move across the screen without animation due to the high number of frames and low number of animation frames. The enemy Dragon and Goryia only use their attacks once needs to be on repeat. Currently the game is stuck on 60 frames for everything, would be better it was adjustable.
