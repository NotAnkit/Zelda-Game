Comments about code: The code is very simple and can easily be read as it
creates the extra boss in the game. The sprite gets drawn and then chnages it's
appearnace based on the damage that it has taken.

Hypothetical change: A change that could be handled pretty easily is if the boss
sprite was different or we wanted to the boss to change color at a different
health. This could be easily added as a different sprite would just need to be
selected from the sprite sheet. The health value can also be adjusted to
accomodate for the color change.
