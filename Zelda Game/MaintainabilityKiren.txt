Comments about code: The code has a lot of the same time and some code that is
commented and not used. The actual code is very simple and and is just drawing
based on what link has in his inventory

Hypothetical change: Currently there is lot of rectangles being draw and such,
and it would be better to have helper methods to make the code simpler and
maybe allow for reuse.
