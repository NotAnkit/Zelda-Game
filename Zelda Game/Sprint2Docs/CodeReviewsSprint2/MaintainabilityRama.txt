Comments on Code Quality:
The quality of this code was very neat and organized.
The code is simple for the purpose of performing the actions of the dragon.
This code would be easy to reuse for other enemies in the game.
Overall, the file has very high standards in code quality and simplicity.

Hypothetical change: If the game needed the dragon to shoot fireballs
upwards, leftwards, and downawards, I believe based on the code quality of this file
that it would be very easy to change it so it shoots fireballs in multiple directions.
