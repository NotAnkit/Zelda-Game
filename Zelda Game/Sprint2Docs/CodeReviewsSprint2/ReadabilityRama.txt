Comments about code: The Update method is really well done and has a very
readable implementation of the enemy’s movement. By using a the random number
and then doing modulus by 4 so that each answer adds or subtracts one form x or
y is easy to understand and read. The animations implementation is easy to read
as it is just counting frames. I used a very similar implementation to animate
all of the aspects of Link.
