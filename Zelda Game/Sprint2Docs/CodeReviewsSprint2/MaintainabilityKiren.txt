Comments about code: The code is very simple and can easily be read as it just
draws the sprite from the sprite sheet.

Hypothetical change: Currently the block are in a stationary position,
but eventually this block will need to be able to move and be pushed by link.
New parameters may have to bepassed in about locations so that the block can be
moved and have its location adjusted. The current class should be able to handle
this change well as new parameters could be easily added.
