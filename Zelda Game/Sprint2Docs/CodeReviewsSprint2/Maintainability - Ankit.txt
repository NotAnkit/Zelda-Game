Comments: Overall, the file is very maintainable.
The sprite is taken from a sprite factory which means that the implelementation is hidden.
The implementations for both changing direction and using an item are also hidden in seperate classes.
The behvior could be easily changed within the other classes without having to change much in the current class.
The code is also very succinct.
Hypothetical Change: Adding another item to use.
This would be easy to support using the current implentation.
An object with the animation moving right and a corresponding method would be added to the sprite factory.
Another if-else statement under UseItem would then be used to call the method in the sprite factory.
