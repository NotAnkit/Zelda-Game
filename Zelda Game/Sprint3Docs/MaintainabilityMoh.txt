Comments on Code Quality:
Overall the code is very maintainable.
Seperating Detection and response made is so that the functionallity could be seperated into different classes.
Additionally, each class could be specified for the specific types of object collision response.
The code could also easily be extended to include more doors or a different player.

Hypothetical Change:
One change that could possibly be made is adding another door.
This could be easily done by following the same process with one more IDoor Object.
Another change could be changing the player.
This could also be done easily by having a different character besides link in the Game1 class.
