Sprint number: 3

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: CollisionDetection.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Rama Naboulsi

Number of minutes: 15 minutes

Comments on Code Quality:
The quality of this code was very neat and organized.
The code is simple for the purpose of detecting collision.
Passing strings as detection to indicate the direction of the collision
was very helpful for implementing collision response.
Overall, the file has very high standards in code quality and simplicity.

Hypothetical change:
A hypothetical change that could be made is by using the rectangle sides as to
which direction the collision is coming from. This would not be optimal, as this
would result in more complicated code. Comparing the overlap height and overlap
width makes it easy to know which direction the collision is coming from.
