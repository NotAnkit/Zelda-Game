Comments about code: The code is very simple and can easily be read as it
responds if an enemy touches a player. The player switches to the damage state
and their position also gets moved back.

Hypothetical change: Currently the all enemy collisons push back link the same
amount, but what if different enemies had different push back.
New parameters may have to be passed in about the enemy type so that the
position of link can be adjusted based on the enemy. The current class should be
able to handle this change well as new parameters could be easily added.
