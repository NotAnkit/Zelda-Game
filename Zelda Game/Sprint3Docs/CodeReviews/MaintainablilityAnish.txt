3. Sprint number:
Sprint 3

4. Name of the .cs file being reviewed:
RoomController.cs

5. Author of the .cs file being reviewed:
Anish Chitti

6. Specific comments on code quality:
The Code is consise in enough for its task. All the rooms are being intiallized
    here which should for next sprint be in its own file.
It only needs to be connected to the Game one file which reduced the coupling.

7. A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed
and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that
change:
I think the loading could be created in a seperate file and save that in game1.
Then we could change the method to take the room number and return it to ensure
the coupling is reduced.
