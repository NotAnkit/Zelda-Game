Comments on Code Quality:
The code is very well written and easy to follow and uses as few lines as possible.
The names of the variables are also descriptive and well formatted.
The if statements are easy to follow in general.
However, some of the lines within the if statements could have been placed into a reusable function because they are repeated.
This would also hide the implementation and increase cohesion.
Overall, though, the code is easily readable.
