Comments about code: The overall code is quite long as it does breach the 150
lines we set as a limit, but each method has a descriptive name an the body does
exactly what the function name says, which makes the overall file quite easy to
read. The names of all the fields/proporties are descriptive enough for the class
as they names indicate what is being stored.
