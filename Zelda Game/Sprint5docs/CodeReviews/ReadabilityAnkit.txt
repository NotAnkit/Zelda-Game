Comments about code: The main body of this class is really well done and has a
very readable implementation of spike enemy also know as the trap.
The spikes movement is special compared to other enemies and it is easy to see
that movement in the update method. It is also to read in the draw function
under what circumstances where the trap should be drawn.
