Comments about code: The overall code is easily maintaible, however it would
help to shorten it since it barely passes the 150 code. The code calls the
draw slections once they are picked up.  


Hypothetical change: A change to the class I would make is shortening the
code by possibly making a file for drawing the DrawSelections and calling them
in the inventory display file.
