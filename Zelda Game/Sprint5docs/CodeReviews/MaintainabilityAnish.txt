Comments about code: The overall code is quite short and easy to read. I would
recommend adding more blocks that are maybe randomly picked from a list to make
it even more random. But overal the code is super easy to manipulate and quickly
change to add more random blocks.

Hypothetical change: A change to the class I would make is chnaging how the
random works. I would make the blocks random aswell and not the predefined 6. I
would also work to add some logic on how to make sure that the blocks are
not overlapping as this could cause the game to crash with two items with the same key.
