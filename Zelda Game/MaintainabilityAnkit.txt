Comments on Code Quality:
The quality of this code was very neat and organized.
The code is simple for the purpose of detecting collision between the player and doors.
Passing strings as detection to indicate the direction of the collision
was very helpful for implementing collision response and then keeping track of links
keys and how many he has at all times.
Using the room manager to manage rooms was coded efficiently.
Overall, the file has very high standards in code quality and simplicity.

Hypothetical change:
A hypothetical change that could be made is to not pass in strings as to
which direction the collision is coming from. This would not be optimal, because this
would result in more complicated code in order to figure which direction the collision
is coming from. Passing in strings for detection makes it easy to know which door the
player in entering and coming out of. The rooms are setup very efficiently.
