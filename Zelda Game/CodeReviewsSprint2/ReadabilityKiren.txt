7. Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
The code is very short and consise, which makes it easy to read. The adding of
blocks one by one is not ideal and takes up a lot of space and is very
repetitive. The if statement is very short, it is two deep so a little complex,
though I do not see a ideal way to fix it.
