3. Sprint number:
Sprint 2

4. Name of the .cs file being reviewed:
ItemController.cs

5. Author of the .cs file being reviewed:
Mohamed Elzubeir

6. Specific comments on code quality:
The Coupling of the program is low, which is good as it only relys on the game
object to add the items, and nothing else to actually make them. The cohesin is
is good as the only task for the file is to rotate between the items, and it has
all the nessessary code and implements the right interface to make it.

7. A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed
and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that
change:
A Hypothetical change that would make the code easier to read and have even
higher coupling is move the list creation to the game1. This game1 doesnt need
to be passed in and the couplding is very low. The problem is it ruins the
cohesion on the game1 class. It also makes it so if there is a change and more
items are added, then there needs to be chnages in two files instead of one.
This could be easily supported as instead of passing in a game object the list
is passed in.
