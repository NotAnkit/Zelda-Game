Comments on Code Quality:
Overall the code is very maintainable.
It is also very easily readable which makes it easy to update.
It also uses the readonly identifier in order to ensure that only certain variables can be changed.

Hypothetical Change:
One change that could possibly be made is changing the speed in which the screen fades.
This can easily be done by increasing and decreasing the count.
Doing so will make the fade happen either quicker or slower.
