Comments about code: Overall the code is very simple and does not have too many
layers thus making it easy to read. The coupling is also not high as it just
relies on the content builder and the inventory of link. Overall It is good maybe
to make it better a good idea would be for each item to have a helper method,
and store those in a seperate file and only call them in the main.
