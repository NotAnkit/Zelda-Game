Sprint number: 4

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: InventoryDisplay.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Rama

Number of minutes: 18 minutes

Comments on Code Quality:
This code was really well-written and well-structured.
To display the inventory in the pause menu, the code is kept as basic as possible.
In order to develop collision response, passing strings as detection to signal the direction of the
collision was quite beneficial.
The overall grade of code quality and simplicity is really good. 

Hypothetical change:
A hypothetical change that could be made is making the draw selection B method able to change weapons, and equip other inventory weapons.
As I am sure this will be completed by the next sprint, given the current code, the change can be easily made.
