Comments about code: The code is very simple and can easily be read as it
handles weapon selection. The sprite gets drawn for whichever weapon wants to be
selected in the inventory to be used.

Hypothetical change: A change that could be handled pretty easily is if a new
weapon was added to the game. This could be easily added as the new weapon would
have to be drawn and then it can be selected. How the weapon functions will be
done by a seperate class.
