Comments about code: The main body of this class is really well done and has a
very readable implementation of freezing and unfreezing of the player and enemies.
Whenever there is a screen transition the freeze method is called so that enemies
don't attack link by setting the speed to zero. Then the unfreeze method is
called to set the speed back to normal.
